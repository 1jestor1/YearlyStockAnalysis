# YearlyStockAnalysis

This VBA code was written to reorganize and some basic analysis of the the raw data of stock prices from 2014 to 2016. The raw data used is organized in the following column order: ticker symbol, date of data,  opening price, highest price of the day, lowest price of the day, closing price, and total volume moved on that day.  This raw data is then organized into a shorted and easier to manipulate summary. This summary includes the ticker symbol, the raw yearly change in price of the stock, the preceding information as a percent, and the total volume moved on that year.
